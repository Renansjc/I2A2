# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an AI Agents Invoice Analysis System (I2A2 Project). The system will receive, classify, and store electronic invoice data (XML format) to create a structured knowledge base. An AI will act as a specialized consultant, providing strategic analysis and quick responses to complex questions about the company's fiscal and financial operations.

## Glossary

- **AI_Agent_System**: The main multi-agent system that coordinates specialized agents for invoice analysis
- **Master_Agent**: The main interface between users and specialized agents, responsible for orchestrating tasks
- **XML_Processing_Agent**: Autonomous agent that processes electronic invoice XML files (NF-e and NFS-e formats)
- **AI_Categorization_Agent**: Agent that applies machine learning to categorize products, suppliers, and operations
- **SQL_Agent**: Specialized agent for building SQL queries based on natural language commands
- **Report_Agent**: Agent responsible for generating reports in formats like .xlsx, .pdf, or .docx
- **Scheduler_Agent**: Agent that transforms queries into automated recurring tasks (CronJobs)
- **Data_Lake_Agent**: Agent that manages centralized storage and provides optimized access for analytics
- **Monitoring_Agent**: Agent responsible for error logging, notifications, and system health monitoring
- **Data_Lake**: Centralized storage where structured invoice data is stored for advanced analysis
- **User_Interface**: Executive-level interface for C-level professionals to interact with the system

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a C-level executive (CEO/CFO/COO), I want to automatically process XML invoice files from a central location, so that I can have structured fiscal data available for strategic decision-making.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new XML file is added to the central directory, THE XML_Processing_Agent SHALL automatically identify and process the file
2. WHEN XML processing occurs, THE XML_Processing_Agent SHALL extract all relevant fiscal data according to NF-e and NFS-e standard formats
3. WHEN data extraction is complete, THE Data_Lake_Agent SHALL store the structured data in the Data_Lake
4. WHERE XML files are in standard NF-e or NFS-e format, THE XML_Processing_Agent SHALL handle all mandatory and optional fields
5. IF XML processing fails, THEN THE Monitoring_Agent SHALL log the error and notify administrators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a C-level executive, I want AI-powered categorization of products, suppliers, and operations, so that I can identify patterns and trends automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invoice data is processed, THE AI_Categorization_Agent SHALL automatically categorize products using machine learning
2. WHEN supplier data is extracted, THE AI_Categorization_Agent SHALL classify suppliers by type, region, and business relationship
3. WHEN fiscal operations are identified, THE AI_Categorization_Agent SHALL categorize them by tax type and business impact
4. WHILE categorization occurs, THE AI_Categorization_Agent SHALL detect patterns and trends in the fiscal data
5. WHERE new categories emerge, THE AI_Categorization_Agent SHALL adapt its classification model accordingly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a C-level executive, I want to ask complex fiscal questions in natural language, so that I can get quick strategic insights without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a natural language question, THE Master_Agent SHALL interpret the user's intention
2. WHEN the intention is understood, THE Master_Agent SHALL route the request to the appropriate specialized agent
3. WHEN the SQL_Agent receives a query request, THE SQL_Agent SHALL generate the corresponding SQL query
4. WHERE the query is complex, THE SQL_Agent SHALL translate business questions like "Which suppliers increased prices the most?" into structured queries
5. WHEN the query is generated, THE Master_Agent SHALL present a preview to the user for confirmation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a C-level executive, I want to generate executive reports in multiple formats, so that I can share fiscal insights with my team and stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user confirms a query, THE Master_Agent SHALL offer report generation options
2. WHEN report generation is requested, THE Report_Agent SHALL create reports in .xlsx, .pdf, or .docx formats
3. WHEN generating reports, THE Report_Agent SHALL format data for executive-level consumption
4. WHERE visualizations are needed, THE Report_Agent SHALL include charts and graphs appropriate for C-level audiences
5. WHEN the report is ready, THE Master_Agent SHALL present a preview for user validation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a C-level executive, I want to schedule recurring fiscal reports, so that I can receive regular updates without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user approves a report format, THE Master_Agent SHALL offer scheduling options
2. WHEN scheduling is requested, THE Scheduler_Agent SHALL create automated recurring tasks
3. WHEN creating schedules, THE Scheduler_Agent SHALL generate CronJob expressions for the specified frequency
4. WHERE recurring reports are scheduled, THE Scheduler_Agent SHALL execute queries automatically at specified intervals
5. WHEN scheduled tasks complete, THE AI_Agent_System SHALL deliver reports to designated recipients

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a C-level executive, I want a centralized data lake for all fiscal information, so that I can perform advanced analytics and maintain historical data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN structured data is ready, THE Data_Lake_Agent SHALL store it in the Data_Lake
2. WHEN data is stored, THE Data_Lake_Agent SHALL maintain data integrity and consistency
3. WHILE storing data, THE Data_Lake_Agent SHALL preserve historical information for trend analysis
4. WHERE data relationships exist, THE Data_Lake_Agent SHALL maintain referential integrity between invoices, suppliers, and products
5. WHEN advanced analytics are needed, THE Data_Lake_Agent SHALL provide optimized access for complex queries
